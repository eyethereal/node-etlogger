# ET Logger

Javascript / ECMAscript already has `console.log()`, why would I use this package? 

Because this package gives you a very lightweight way to get much more useful logs.

The goal of ETLogger is to be super easy to integrate into your project while still providing an upgrade and centralization of loggine output for your codebase. The idea being that if everything is flowing through it, then you can get point those logging events at various other places really easily.
